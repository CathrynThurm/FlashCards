FlashCards is a program where the user can create, edit, and study flashcards.
I created this project using Javascript, React, HTML5, and Bootstrap for CSS.
This program was made to be a quick no frills way for students to quickly create and study anything they need.
The back end makes API calls to the data base to fetch and retreive data while the front end simply connects the user with an intuitive UI.
